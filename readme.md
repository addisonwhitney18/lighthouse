[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleChrome/lighthouse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleChrome/lighthouse)

_status: early. sorta working_

## Install
```sh
npm install -g GoogleChrome/lighthouse
```

## Run
```sh
# Start Chrome with a few flags
npm explore -g lighthouse -- npm run chrome

# Kick off a lighthouse run
lighthouse https://airhorner.com/

# see flags and options
lighthouse --help
```

## Develop

#### Setup
```sh
git clone https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse
cd lighthouse

npm install
npm link
```

## Tests

Some basic unit tests forked are in `/test` and run via mocha. eslint is also checked for style violations.

```js
# lint and test all files
npm test

# watch for file changes and run tests
#   Requires http://entrproject.org : brew install entr
npm run watch

## run linting and unit tests seprately
npm run lint
npm run unit
```

## Chrome Extension

The same audits are run against from a Chrome extension. See [./extension](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/tree/master/extension).


## Architecture

_Some incomplete notes_

#### Components
* **Driver** - Interfaces with Chrome Debugging Protocol
* **Gathers** - Requesting data from the browser (and maybe post-processing)
* **Artifacts** - The output of gatherers
* **Audits** - Non-performance evaluations of capabilities and issues. Includes a raw value and score of that value.
* **Metrics** - Performance metrics summarizing the UX
* **Diagnoses** - The perf problems that affect those metrics
* **Aggregators** - Pulling audit results, grouping into user-facing components (eg. `install_to_homescreen`) and applying weighting and overall scoring.

### Protocol

* _Interacting with Chrome:_ The Chrome protocol connection maintained via  [chrome-remote-interface](https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface) for the CLI and [`chrome.debuggger` API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/debugger) when in the Chrome extension.
* _Event binding & domains_: Some domains must be `enable()`d so they issue events. Once enabled, they flush any events that represent state. As such, network events will only issue after the domain is enabled. All the protocol agents resolve their `Domain.enable()` callback _after_ they have flushed any pending events. See example:

```js
// will NOT work
driver.sendCommand('Security.enable').then(_ => {
	driver.on('Security.securityStateChanged', state => { /* ... */ });
})

// WILL work! happy happy. :)
driver.on('Security.securityStateChanged', state => { /* ... */ }); // event binding is synchronous
driver.sendCommand('Security.enable');
```
* _Debugging the protocol_: Read [Better debugging of the Protocol](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/184).

### Gatherers

* _Reading the DOM:_ We prefer reading the DOM right from the browser (See #77). The driver exposes a `querySelector` method that can be used along with a `getAttribute` method to read values.

### Audits

The return value of each audit takes this shape:

```js
Promise.resolve({
  name: 'audit-name',
  tags: ['what have you'],
  description: 'whatnot',
  // value: The score. Typically a boolean, but can be number 0-100
  value: 0,
  // rawValue: Could be anything, as long as it can easily be stringified and displayed,
  //   e.g. 'your score is bad because you wrote ${rawValue}'
  rawValue: {},
  // debugString: Some *specific* error string for helping the user figure out why they failed here.
  //   The reporter can handle *general* feedback on how to fix, e.g. links to the docs
  debugString: 'Your manifest 404ed'
  // fault:  Optional argument when the audit doesn't cover whatever it is you're doing,
  //   e.g. we can't parse your particular corner case out of a trace yet.
  //   Whatever is in `rawValue` and `score` would be N/A in these cases
  fault: 'some reason the audit has failed you, Anakin'
});
```

## Code Style

The `.eslintrc` defines all.

We're using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) along with [closure annotations](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler). Annotations encouraged for all contributions.

`const` > `let` > `var`.  Use `const` wherever possible. Save `var` for emergencies only.

## Trace processing

The traceviewer-based trace processor from [node-big-rig](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/node-big-rig/tree/master/lib) was forked into Lighthouse. Additionally, the [DevTools' Timeline Model](https://github.com/paulirish/devtools-timeline-model) is available as well. There may be advantages for using one model over another.

**To update traceviewer source:**

```sh
# if not already there, clone catapult and copy license over
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult.git third_party/src/catapult
cp third_party/src/catapult/LICENSE third_party/traceviewer-js/
# pull for latest
git -C "./third_party/src/catapult/" pull
# run our conversion script
node scripts/build-traceviewer-module.js
```
